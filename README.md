Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Our task was to use Python and C++ to create an item tracking application. My software was created by adding to the initial code that I had for both Python and C++. Using a text file as input, this project generated a list of every item bought in a given day along with how many times it was bought. It also produced a histogram that showed the goods bought and how many times they were bought, and it could be used to input an item and get back the number of times it was bought.

What did you do particularly well?

Overall, I think the initiative was executed really effectively. The way I was able to employ color to improve the program's appearance for the user pleased me. The C++ code is divided into functions, and to make it easier to read and comprehend, I only call one function in the main.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

One of my primary goals was to make the software look better. To that end, I capitalized the initial letter of the output to give it a more polished appearance and displayed alternatives for user input for option 2.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The switch case was one section of the code that I struggled with the most. My first assumption was incorrect; a lot more work was involved. Getting the menu space just right also took some time for me. I walked away from the program when I became frustrated or trapped. Up until I figured it out, I would make one modification and run the program. It is far simpler to modify or add a single tiny item to each part than to attempt to complete everything at once.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I would find it very helpful to connect Python and C++ in future projects when I need to connect several programming languages. In other projects, being able to read and create text files would be helpful.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make things simpler to read and comprehend, I organized everything into functions. Additionally, it makes any necessary changes much simpler to implement.
